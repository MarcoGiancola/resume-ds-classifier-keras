"On LinkedIn, he is the data science evangelist and community manager but everyone knows that his photography skills totally overshadow his data science knowledge these days. On Twitter, he sounds like a die-hard MATLAB fanboy with the handle @matlabulous (because MATLAB was his favourite tool at Uni). Since joining H2O.ai in 2016, Joe has delivered H2O talks/workshops in 40+ cities around Europe and US. 

Before joining H2O, he was in the business intelligence team at Virgin Media where he developed data products to enable quick and smart business decisions. He also worked remotely for Domino Data Lab as a data science evangelist promoting products via blogging and giving talks at external events. 

Joe has a background in water engineering. Before his data science journey, he was an EngD researcher at STREAM Industrial Doctorate Centre working on machine learning techniques for drainage design optimization. Prior to that, he was an asset management consultant specialized in data mining and constrained optimization for the utilities sector in UK and abroad. He also holds a MSc in Environmental Management and a BEng in Civil Engineering.

Long before Joe immersed himself in the world of open-source R and Python, he learned his trade as an avid MATLAB user. When he was a kid, his parents taught him one of the famous old Chinese sayings - when one drinks water, one must not forget where it comes from. So when Twitter asked Joe to be creative, he simply put down @matlabulous as his handle.

In the summer of 2014, his data visualization side project 'CrimeMap' led him to a poster presentation at useR! 2014 where he heard about H2O for the very first time. He has been using H2O for various data science projects ever since. ";1

"I was raised in the farmlands of Missouri until age fourteen when my family moved to Louisiana.
In 1991, at age 21, I married a beautiful woman of God and we raised four children together.
Many offer degrees and accomplishments to justify their authority as an author; I offer this.
I spent many years as a christian buried alive. I had turned away from the false life offered by Adam but surrounded by the darkness of self effort I kicked,beat, and scratched against the walls of mans religious casket; desperately trying to reach the light. It was not until I gave up that a still small voice asked are you ready to trust me? Then I was in the light.
It is my desire to encourage and strengthen the faith of my brethren in the Lord. To the end that the frustration of trying to live for God would be replaced with the peace and joy of God living in and through us. ";0

"As a physicist, I have a mathematical mindset, which takes me to have a rational and analytical approach to problem solving. 
On the other hand, my love for arts, literature and music, makes me a little bit visionary and gives me that healthy dose of creativity as well, which really helps in data science.

I have been working as a data scientist since 2003, collecting a wide range of complementary skills and meeting really different use cases, businesses and problems. I think that these experiences, on the basis of my scientific background, made me the data scientist that I am today: a professional with strong skills in statistics, mathematical modeling, data analysis, machine learning and advanced information technology.

What I consider one of my key features, is that I can manage any stage of data life cycle, from data management, through data analysis and modeling, up to design and development of data products based on cloud technologies.

I have been working in different fields, but those where I have the deeper domain expertise are pharmaceutical and manufacturing, followed by marketing one.

A quick list of my main skills could be as follows: databases, data analysis, machine learning, predictive models, cloud technologies, R language, mathematical models, data mining, Six Sigma methodology ";1

Currently I support BCG clients to exploit the opportunities enabled by data science, and lead teams of Business Experts, ITs and Data Scientists toward game-changing deliveries. I’m also in charge for the development of BCG GAMMA in Italy, Greece and Turkey.

Given I’m truly passionate about business innovation and mentoring, I also support innovative startups, teach Data Science for Management at the University of Florence and collaborate with National and International Associations to promote Data Driven Business Innovation. ";1

"I’m a Physicist, currently working as Data Scientist and Project Manager, with a background in scientific research and data science.

Since 2015 I have been working as Data Scientist in consulting, gaining advanced expertise in data statistical analysis, especially in Bayesian framework, big data analytics, data and text mining, social media mining and machine learning. Such expertise have been applied to manage projects in different sectors and areas, e.g. predictive maintenance, CRM, strategic marketing, capacity planning, fraud detection, credit scoring, news alert from text, road safety assessment from video analysis and much more. My major interest is now in the application of Artificial Intelligence, especially Deep Learning, to text mining and natural language processing, towards a fully natural machine to human communication in the field of B2C services.
My strong background in statistics, analysis of huge volumes of data, AI and machine learning comes from my PhD in Particle Physics, and from the seven years I spent as a researcher in the major High Energy Physics Laboratories, namely CERN (Geneva), DESY (Hamburg) and FERMILAB (Chicago). In those years I gained a wide expertise in most of the fundamental aspects of experimental Particle Physics, including detector-related aspects and the most forefront and challenging data analyses. I have been leading several physics analyses, from precision measurements to searches for new phenomena, and I have been editor of several papers published on high-impact peer-reviewed journals. This experience made me an independent and versatile researcher.
