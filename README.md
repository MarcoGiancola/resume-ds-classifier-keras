In the article https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/applications-ai-recruitment-selection-marco-giancola-xhtef/ I speak about the applications of AI in recruitment and selection and I introduce a simple example of a neural network that can be used in the area of recruitment and selection; I implemented it in 2019 as the final project of the Advanced School in Artificial Intelligence (https://as-ai.org/) that, at that time, I was attending. I developed a neural network capable of performing a binary classification of Curriculum Vitae i.e., distinguishing the CVs of data scientists from those of those in a completely different profession.
To write the code for this classifier, I used the Python language, the Google Colab platform and the Keras library. To train and test the network, I created a CSV file where, to make my job easier, I entered not actual CVs but rather the contents of the “About” section of 300 LinkedIn profiles, about half of which belong to data scientists, or at any rate to people skilled in Data Science/Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence. I matched the label “1” to the CVs of data scientists and the label “0” to everyone else. Thus, in the first column of the file there are textual, summary descriptions of the work experience, studies, and skills of 300 professionals registered on LinkedIn, while in the second column we have binary figures (0 and 1).
